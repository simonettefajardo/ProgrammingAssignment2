##Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
##benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
##repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
##not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that
##cache the inverse of a matrix.
###For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

##`makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special "matrix" object
##that can cache its inverse.

##The first function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix", which is
##really a list containing a function to

##1.  set the value of the matrix
##2.  get the value of the matrix
##3.  set the value of the inverse 
##4.  get the value of the inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() inv
    list(set = set, get = get,setinverse = setinverse,getinverse = getinverse)
  
  
}

##`cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special
##"matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
## already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
##`cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

###Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the `solve`
###function in R. For example, if `X` is a square invertible matrix, then
###`solve(X)` returns its inverse.



cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
    inv <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(inv)
    inv
}
